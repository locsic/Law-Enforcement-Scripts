hachoir-urwid is a binary file explorer based on Hachoir library to parse the
files. Using this tool you can exactly know the meaning of each bit/byte of
your files. With direction keys, you can navigate in the field tree. The key
'h' will disable 'human display' and switch to 'raw display'. It's sometime
useful when you would like to compare hexadecimal data and Hachoir
reprensentation.
