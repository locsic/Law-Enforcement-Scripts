Known bugs
==========

 * [All]: Field view "Merge Down" doesn't work.

 * [Windows only]: Hex view only shows a ~4x5 char display of the
   data. This is believed to be due to a wxWidgets bugs related to text
   wrapping.

 * [Windows only]: Right-click context menu doesn't work.

 * [Windows only]: Hex view data marking doesn't work.

 * [Gtk only]: Hex view will occasionally show two scrollbars for the
   hex view if you resize the very quickly. This is likely a bug in
   wxGtk that (for some reason) ignores the "no vertical scrollbar"
   directive for text controls.
