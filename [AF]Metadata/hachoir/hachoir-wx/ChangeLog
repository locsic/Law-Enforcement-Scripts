hachoir-wx 0.1 Initial Release (all platforms)
==============================================

Features:
 * Lazy-loaded hex view, meaning you can view a 20GB file and memory
   usage will remain constant, and the GUI will remain responsive.

 * Dynamic type conversion, meaning (for example) you can take a
   RawBytes field of size 4 and convert it to a UInt32 for a better
   look at your data.

 * Field splitting, meaning you can take a RawBytes range and split it
   into smaller ranges. This feature in conjunction with dynamic type
   conversion allows you to explore unknown binary formats more easily.

 * Field view that allows you to browse a binary file just like a
   directory.

 * Minor stuff like hex/dec view of addresses, absolute/relative field
   offsets, auto-resizing field view columns that stretch to the size of
   your data, etc.

 * Hex view automatically scrolls to and highlights the hex data of
   the currently selected field (called "marking".)

 * Field dumping, meaning you can select any field inside your binary
   file and save it on your hard disk for further
   examination/analysis/etc.
