hachoir-wx is a wxWidgets-based program that's meant to provide a
(more) user-friendly interface to the facilities provided by the
hachoir binary parser core.

For latest updates, to ask for a feature (please do!), and
bleeding(-edge) source code see the website:

Everyone is very welcome to contribute code =)
